2 + 12: shoulders
1 + 13: flexor

up/down arms motion:
- compare line across chest to line between shoulder and elbow (x + y values)
  -- left version of that controls servo 2 + 1
  -- right version of that controls servo 12 + 13

shoulder rotation motion:
- compare line from thumb to wrist (22 to 16 e.g.) to line between wrist and elbow (16 to 14 e.g.) (x + y values)
-- servo 2 and 12

in/out of the screen motion:
- compare line across chest to line between shoulder and elbow (x + z values)
-------
shoulder:
- arm moving from full forward in/out to full up (zero in/out, max y value, min x value) - track 0-11 line against 12-14 line (y/z values of each of those lines)

flexor, shoulder at 0: 
- shoulder-to-shoulder to shoulder-to-elbow/wrist (x/y values)

flexor, shoulder at 90:
- shoulder-to-shoulder to shoulder-to-elbow/wrist (x/z values)
